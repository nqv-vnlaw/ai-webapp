# Acceptance Checklists

**Last Reviewed:** 2025-12-26  
**Legend:** ✅ implemented (frontend repo) · 🟨 partial/spec-only · ☐ not started / backend required

## Current Implementation Status (Codebase)
- Phase 1 (Scaffolding): ✅ complete
- Phase 2 (API client & TanStack Query wiring): ✅ complete
- Phase 3 (Search Feature): ✅ complete (2025-12-26)
- Phase 4+ (Chat UI and beyond): ☐ not started

## 15. MVP Acceptance Criteria (App #1: Precedent Search Bot Web)
MVP is accepted when:
1) Only `@vnlaw.com.vn` users can access after login.
2) Search works for Precedent scope: results show title/snippet/link.
3) Chat answers display with citations (when available).
4) Errors show user-friendly messages; retry works for transient failures.
5) `vnlaw.app` is served via Cloudflare → Netlify, and API calls go to Cloud Run BFF.
