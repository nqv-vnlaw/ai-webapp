  "answer": "The provided clause states that the Seller is not liable for any Claim if the Losses related to that Claim can be recovered by the Purchaser under any of the Purchaser's or a Group Company's insurance policies. This is a common contractual provision designed to allocate risk and prevent double recovery of losses.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the legal implications:\n\n• **Limitation of Liability**: This clause acts as a limitation on the Seller's liability. It means that even if the Seller is otherwise responsible for a loss, their obligation to compensate the Purchaser is reduced or eliminated to the extent that the Purchaser can recover those losses through their own insurance.\n\n• **Insurance as Primary Recourse**: The clause effectively makes the Purchaser's insurance policies the primary source of recovery for certain losses, rather than the Seller directly.\n\n• **\"Claim\" and \"Losses\"**: The terms \"Claim\" and \"Losses\" are central to this clause. While the provided documents define \"Claim\" in some contexts as including \"Warranty Claim, Tax Claim, Reimbursement Claim\", and \"Losses\" can include \"direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal costs\", the specific definitions within the contract containing this clause would govern its interpretation.\n\n• **Burden of Proof**: The Purchaser would likely bear the burden of demonstrating that the losses are *not* recoverable under their insurance policies if they wish to pursue a claim against the Seller.\n\n• **Subrogation (Implied)**: Although not explicitly stated in the provided clause, such a provision often implies that the Purchaser's insurer, after paying out a claim, would not have subrogation rights against the Seller for the recovered amount. This prevents the insurer from then suing the Seller for the same losses.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness and interpretation of such a clause can depend on the governing law of the contract and the specific wording of other related provisions within the agreement.",
